# CandyShopProject
This project is proposed to build a Candy Store App using Android Studio. I will create the functionality of the App and add more features to it such as Explicit Intent that opens another Activity, and Implicit Intents that opens up a Map, dials a telephone number and shares content. It is part of my Google Scholarship for Africa 2019 Project Phase.
